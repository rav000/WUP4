To provide you with the appropriate list of updates, Windows Update must collect a certain amount of configuration information from your computer. None of this configuration information can be used to identify you. This information includes:<BR>
<UL type=square>
<LI>Operating-system version number 
<LI>Internet Explorer version number 
<LI>Version numbers of other software for which Windows Update provides updates 
<LI>Plug and Play ID numbers of hardware devices 
<LI>Region and Language setting </LI></UL>The configuration information collected is used only to determine the appropriate updates and to generate aggregate statistics. Windows Update does not collect your name, address, e-mail address, or any other form of personally identifiable information.<BR><BR>Windows Update also collects the Product ID and Product Key to confirm that you are running a validly licensed copy of Windows. A validly licensed copy of Windows ensures that you will receive on-going updates from Windows Update. The Product ID and Product Key are not retained beyond the end of the Windows Update session, unless the Product ID is not valid.<BR><BR>To provide you with the best possible service, Windows Update also tracks and records how many unique machines visit its site and whether the download and installation of specific updates succeeded or failed. In order to do this, the Windows operating system generates a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) that is stored on your computer to uniquely identify it. The GUID does not contain any personally identifiable information and cannot be used to identify you. Windows Update records the GUID of the computer that attempted the download, the ID of the item that you attempted to download and install, and the configuration information listed above.<BR><BR><BR><A class=aboutHeader name=windowscatalog>Windows Update Catalog</A><BR>The Windows Update Catalog provides a comprehensive listing of updates that can be distributed over a corporate network.

				<b>Why do I get a message saying an ActiveX control on this page is not safe?</b><br />
				This message is displayed when your security setting in Internet Explorer is set too high.

<LI><B>What is an ActiveX control?</B><BR>ActiveX Controls are reusable software components that incorporate ActiveX technology. These components can be used to add specialized functionality, such as animation or pop-up menus, to Web pages, programs, and software development tools. Windows Update uses ActiveX controls to check what software is installed on your computer in order to provide you with a correct list of updates and other software you may want to download.<BR>
